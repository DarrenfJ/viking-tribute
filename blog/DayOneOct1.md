#Day 1

oooOooo. I've never *not* used a CDN to load libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap.

So it will be fun to actually have the CSS code at my fingertips.

Not fun to figure out what to link (minified files etc)

####CDN

(from: http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html)

>"A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver pages and other Web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server."

####Bootstrap

(from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14546709/what-is-bootstrap)

>"It is an HTML, CSS, javascript framework that you can use as a basis for creating web sites or web applications."

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/

####Framework

(from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2964140/what-is-a-software-framework)

>" But, I would like to share one example which I only thought of today. If I told you to cut a piece of paper with dimensions 5m by 5m then surely you would do that. But then I ask you to cut 1000 pieces of paper of the same dimensions. Then you won't do the measuring 1000 times, obviously you would make a frame of 5m by 5m and then with the help of it you would be able to cut 1000 papers in less time. So, what you did is made a framework which would do that type of task. So, instead of performing the same type of task again and again for the same type of applications, what you do is create a framework having all those facilities together in one nice packet, hence providing the abstraction for your application and more importantly many applications."

(from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)

>"In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications. A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.

>Frameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries:

>**inversion of control:** In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.
>**extensibility:** A user can extend the framework - usually by selective overriding; or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.
>**non-modifiable framework code:** The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but should not modify its code.


Minified files;

Edit:

have to find google fonts...

and 

This is something I always have to re-remember..
